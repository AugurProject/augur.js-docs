============

We think Augur and Ethereum are pretty awesome, and believe that they're going to change the world.  We'd love it if you want to be a part of this -- as a user, tester, or developer!

We use [Github issues](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/issues) as our bug tracker and to-do list.  If you want to put your shoulder to the wheel, just pick an issue you want to work on, comment on it to let us know you want to tackle it, and we'll help you get it done.

Most of our day-to-day conversation happens in our Slack.  (We also have an IRC gateway in #augur on Freenode that is connected to our Slack chat!)  Our Slack is totally open.  If you'd like to join the conversation, just go to [slackinaugur.herokuapp.com](https://slackinaugur.herokuapp.com) and sign up.
