============

We think Augur and Ethereum are pretty awesome, and believe that they're going to change the world.  We'd love it if you want to be a part of this -- as a user, tester, or developer!

Most of our day-to-day conversation happens in our Slack.  (We also have an IRC gateway in #augur on Freenode that is connected to our Slack chat!)  Our Slack is open.  If you'd like to join the conversation, just go to [slack.augur.net](http://slack.augur.net) and sign up.
