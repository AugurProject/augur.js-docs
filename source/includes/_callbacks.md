Augur API methods that submit transactions to the network (using the `eth_sendTransaction` RPC) take three callbacks, in the following order:

- onSent: fires when the transaction has been broadcast to the network.
- onSuccess: fires when the transaction has been successfully incorporated into a block.
- onFailed: fires if the RPC request returns an error.

The `onSent`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailed` callbacks are optional.  If `onSent` is not included, then the transaction will run in synchronous (blocking) mode; if it is included, then the transaction will be run in asynchronous mode.  If the `onSuccess` callback is supplied, augur.js will issue an `eth_getTransaction` request upon receipt of every new block, until the transaction record contains a non-null `blockHash` value, or the transaction record itself returns `null` (indicating that the transaction has failed).

Augur API methods that perform read-only RPC requests that do not submit transactions to the network (using the `eth_call` RPC) take a single optional callback as their last parameter.  Like `sendTransaction` requests, call requests can be synchronous or asynchronous: if a callback is supplied, the request will be made asynchronously.

<aside class="warning">Synchronous HTTP RPC is generally not recommended, especially if augur.js is running in the browser.  Synchronous RPC requests block the main JavaScript thread, which essentially freezes the browser!</aside>
