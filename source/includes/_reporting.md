Reporting
=========

<a href="images/reporting_cycle.svg"><img src="images/reporting_cycle.svg" onerror="this.src='images/reporting_cycle.png'"></a>

This diagram shows the Reporting cycle for an event (and its associated market) which was created during some previous cycle (off the diagram to the left) and which expires sometime during the cycle marked as "Reporting cycle 1".  Each cycle takes 60 days to complete.  Including the steps needed to fully complete all payouts and Reputation redistribution, resolving an event takes three full Reporting cycles.

<aside class="notice">In Augur, the terms "Reporting period" and "Reporting cycle" are used interchangeably throughout the codebase.</aside>

Reporting outcomes
------------------

### Yes or no (binary)
- no: `2**64`
- yes: `2*2**64`
- indeterminate: `3*2**63`
- exactly in the middle but not indeterminate: `2**63 + 1`

### Multiple choice (categorical)

- min: `1`
- max: `2**64`
- indeterminate: `2**63`
- exactly in the middle but not indeterminate: `2**63 + 1`

### Numerical (scalar)
- min: `1`
- max: `2**64`
- indeterminate: `2**63`
- exactly in the middle but not indeterminate: `2**63 + 1`
