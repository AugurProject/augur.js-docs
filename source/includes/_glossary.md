Glossary
========
<aside class="notice">The Glossary section is still under construction and may be missing some information. Don't worry! We plan to update the entire documentation prior to Augur launching. Thank you for your patience as we make these updates.</aside>
<!--
this section will include subsections for all terms used and descriptions of what they are and what they do. This is to avoid repeating them same information over and over again in function descriptions in the API section. This section should be easy to navigate and easy to link to specific concepts. To that end, each concept should have it's own subsection.
 -->
This section of the documentation is dedicated to terms found and used throughout the rest of documentation. Below you will find sections about terms used in Augur. The goal is to explain everything that might be confusing in an easy to understand way.
